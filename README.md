# ~~Bird's~~ Dragon's Eye View 

Originally I had the idea that it would be cool to be able to explore the streets of the city grid from a bird's eye view for a scenic experience. This could incorporate Google Maps technology. Then I thought that it might be a bit unsettling to feel like you're floating in 3D space, so maybe you would also be riding something, like a dragon. And you could also make the dragon breathe fire. 

# Music Experience

I tried using TiltBrush with music (some of the brushes include effects that pulse in rhythm to the song) and I would be excited to explore the possibilities of music in VR. Beyond visualizations, there could be interactive components in which the user could make sounds/beats of their own. This is obviously a very open-ended idea, but I think a lot of creative things could be done with music in VR. 

# Heartbeat Visualizer

The user's heartbeat is read and simultaneously visualized with a 3D object (doesn't have to be a heart) that pulses in sync to the heartbeat. Though simple, this could be a sort of immersive meditative experience in focusing on one's heartbeat. Or if meditation's not for you, you could see how high you can get your heartrate by running in place. 

# Scenic Run

The idea of jogging in place made me think of combining it with my first idea in which you could go on a scenic jog in VR from the comfort of your home (but with the discomfort of jogging while wearing a VR headset.. also less fun than riding a dragon).
